3. Update the `README.md` with the new version.
4. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` for the impending release.
5. Run `git commit -am "Prepare for release X.Y.Z"` (where X.Y.Z is the new version).
6. `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"` (where X.Y.Z is the new version).
7. Run `./gradlew clean bintrayUpload`.
8. Run `git push origin`.
9. Create a pull request from the `develop` to the `master` branch on GitHub for the new version, if not already done.
10. Sign in on Bintray and publish the packages.
11. Run `git push origin --tags`.

## Publishing a SNAPSHOT

1. Make sure `library_version` ext property in root project's `build.gradle` file is set to
a -SNAPSHOT version.
2. Run `./gradlew artifactoryPublish`. **Do it from command line,
not from Android Studio**, as the artifacts are not uploaded when the
gradle task is run from the IDE (as of Android Studio `3.1.0-rc01`) because
of a yet to be reported bug.
